        <h1>Hilbert Curves!</h1>
        <p>Is a form of space filling fractal. It's useful for visualization when you have sorted 1-dimensional data. It would be hard to show in a long horizontal chart without making everything too small, and splitting the long row of data into multiple rows that wrap around would be data points that are close in the sorted list, could appear on opposite sides of the chart.</p>
        <p>By plotting points on a hilbert curve, data points that are sorted closely remain close in the chart. I wanted to try plotting weather data this way, so here you go! <strong>You'll see big marco-blocks of colour that will represent longer periods like months or seasons.</strong> I made it animate... because it's pretty.</p>
